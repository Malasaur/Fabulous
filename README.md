# Fabulous!

**Fabulous!** is a Vanilla++ modpack based on [Fabulously Optimized](https://modrinth.com/modpack/fabulously-optimized), which adds tons of beautiful client-side enhancements, gameplay polish, and additional optimization tools to make Minecraft look and feel _truly majestic_, even without shaders. Who needs shaders anyways?

## What's inside?

* **Performance**
  Built on top of Fabulously Optimized, this pack adds even more optimization and profiling mods for smooth gameplay with minimal setup. Just gimme that fine speed bruh üôè

* **Enhanced Visuals**
  Dynamic lighting, ambient sounds, fog effects, improved animations, redefined entities, and more. Your world will truly look ‚ú® beautiful ‚ú® - you can even download resources and shaders in-game!

* **Quality of Life**
  Helpful tooltips, JEI, Jade, minimaps, ~~zoomers~~ zoom functionality, UI tweaks, block information... great for beginners and technical players alike. Never forget how to craft your nuclear reactor again ‚ò¢Ô∏è

* **Gameplay Tweaks**
  Smart block placement, customizable armor stands and other fixes that make the vanilla experience smoother and more fun. Because we Java players also deserve proper bridging üò†

* **Social & Customization**
  Skins, capes, emotes, emojis and voice chat, all preconfigured to make multiplayer more expressive and seamless. Show off your dragon skin to all your friends! üêâ

* **Expansion Friendly**
  This pack was built with expansion in mind. It tries to be as compatible as it can be with other mods. A perfect example is [RandomAhhPack](https://modrinth.com/modpack/RandomAhhPack), which uses Fabulous! along with 100+ random mods and doesn't crash. Most of the time.

## Server compatibility

This pack includes a few mods, like Simple Voice Chat, WATUT and EmoteCraft, that include server-side features. If the server doesn't have them installed, they should just disable themselves and hopefully not crash your whole computer.

Also, if playing on big servers, consider disabling mods like Better Bridging as they could get you banned for cheating. I mean, it is not cheating, but admins think it is, so you better be cautious (also, maybe don‚Äôt enable XRay unless you‚Äôre in for a "friendly chat" with an admin).

<summary>Note</summary>
This isn‚Äôt a professional level modpack (yet‚Ñ¢). It‚Äôs just FO with extra mods, tweaks, and resource packs thrown at it. While it‚Äôs fast, beautiful, and highly usable, I can't guarantee stability nor compatibility with other mods.

Fabulously Optimized itself has years of development, regular updates, and a large community. This pack builds on that solid foundation, but keep in mind: it's a personal project, not a finished product.
